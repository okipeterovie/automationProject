# automationProject

1) This was built with Java 17 and Selenium. 

2) Install using maven. I recommend using IntelliJ IDE. There is a Maven tab on the left side that you can easily use.

3) When running tests locally, it is easier to use the TestNG plugin on the IDE. The GUI of the IDE can be used to trigger tests.

4) Tests are found in the tests package. But you can also run the Tests from Main class. just have to set the CURRENT_TEST_ID property.
